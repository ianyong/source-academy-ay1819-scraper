# Source Academy AY19/20 Scraper

For use with the [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg/), a gamified platform developed in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore for teaching the module CS1101S - Programming Methodology.

Once the semester concludes, it is highly likely that the submissions made on the Source Academy will no longer be available for viewing. This program scrapes all the submissions and saves the programs locally.

Because the Source Academy is constantly being improved upon, it is likely that this scraper will cease to work in future semesters.
